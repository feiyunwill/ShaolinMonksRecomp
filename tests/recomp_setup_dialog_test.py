"""Check game selection: the launcher opens on its game page until a usable game is chosen.

The launcher runs with --launcher-test, which keeps the real launcher logic and drawing but opens no window.
On Windows the processes run on a private desktop. --setup keeps the system dialog for runs without the launcher.
